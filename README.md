## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for practicing coding problems, and this repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these problems. Each solution is implemented in a specific programming language and organized in dedicated folders.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`ProblemNumber-ProblemTitle`**: Each folder corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem and is named with the format `ProblemNumber-ProblemTitle`.

  - **`ProblemTitle.ext`**: Contains the solution code for the problem in a specific programming language (e.g., `ProblemTitle.CPP` for C++).

  - **`README.md`**: Includes the problem description.

## How to Use
